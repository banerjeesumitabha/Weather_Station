# Weather_Station
A Weather App displaying sensor data from Arduino in real time (assuming the starting and ending characters are indicated by two special characters).
The Arduino sends data via a Bluetooth module (HC-05 in my case). The special characters I used for indicating the start and end of data are ">" and "~".
